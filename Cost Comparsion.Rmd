## Cost Calculation 

The cost of contacting a customer and the revenue after client accpeting the campaign are given by the dataset which we will use. 

The cost to contact: $30
The revenue after client accept campaign: $110 

We will be using the sensitivity and specificity to calculate the potential revenue earn an individual customer. 


```{r}
cost <- 30
revenue <- 110

extract_metrics_cost <- function(cm) {
  sensitivity <- as.numeric(cm$byClass['Sensitivity'])
  specificity <- as.numeric(cm$byClass['Specificity'])
  
  expected_revenue <- revenue * sensitivity -
                      cost * (1-specificity)
  data.frame(
    Expected_Revenue = expected_revenue
  )
}
comparison_table <- rbind(
  GLM = extract_metrics_cost(lr_cm_interactions),
  KNN = extract_metrics_cost(knn_advanced_cm),
  ANN = extract_metrics_cost(ann_base_matrix),
  DecisionTree = extract_metrics_cost(dt_cm),
  SVM = extract_metrics_cost(svm_cm),
  RandomForest = extract_metrics_cost(rf_cm),
  CostStack = extract_metrics_cost(cost_cm)
)
kable(comparison_table, 
      caption = "Comparison of All Models: Expected Cost",
      digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                full_width = F,
                position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "black")
